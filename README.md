VITAL: Versatile Image Transformation and Automated Labeling
VITAL is a novel framework designed to enhance medical image processing by combining multi-conditional augmentation and automated labeling. This approach ensures high-quality image generation tailored to specific conditions, improving both dataset quality and diagnostic efficiency.

Key Features
Multi-Conditional Augmentation: Tailors data augmentation based on diverse conditions, such as image modality and medical attributes.
Automated Labeling: Uses conditional augmentation to generate precise labels, reducing manual effort and error.
High Fidelity and Precision: Ensures generated images retain clinical relevance through intelligent integration of multiple conditions.
Methodology
Diffusion-Based Backbone: Leverages the DiffAE model for high-quality image generation.
Multi-Conditional Decomposition: Decomposes medical images into distinct elements such as:
Mask: Ground truth masks adjusted via convolution layers.
Color: Dominant color extraction using ColorThief.
Fovea/Optic Disc (OD): Manually labeled coordinates.
Style: Extracted using SimSiam and enhanced with jigsaw augmentation.
Inference Workflow:
Masks generated with DDIM.
Other components estimated using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
Components integrated in DiffAE to produce conditionally controlled retinal images.
Results
Conducted experiments on 1,745 image-mask pairs from datasets including DRIVE, CHASEDB, ARIA, and others.
Demonstrated precise control over generated images by modifying specific conditions (e.g., mask, color, OD).
Achieved consistent quality and clinical relevance across varied scenarios.
Future Directions
Enhance handling of the mask condition by preserving spatial details using 2D tensor representations instead of 1D latent vectors.
Explore advanced conditioning mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy and robustness.
Applications
VITAL is ideal for:

Medical image augmentation and labeling.
Training robust models for retinal feature detection (e.g., fovea, OD).
Generating high-fidelity images for diagnostic support.
